I have my heart on my fist
Like a blind falcon

Taciturn bird gripping my fingers
Lamp swollen with wine and blood,
I descend
Towards the tomb of the kings
Astonished
Barely born

What thread of Ariadne
Leads me through muted labyrinths
The echoing steps are swallowed as they fall

(In what dream
Was this child tied by her ankle
Like a fascinated slave?)

The maker of the dream
Draws on the thread
And the naked footfalls come
One by one
Like the first drops of rain
In the hold of the well

Already the odour stirs in swollen storms
Sweats under door-sills
Of secret, round chambers,
There, where curtained beds are raised.

The still desire of reclining kings|Leads me
I see, astonished,
On the black bones gleam
Blue inlaid stones.

A few tragedies, patiently wrought,
Laid on the breast of kings
Are offered me
In the guise of jewels
With no regrets, no tears.

In a single line arrayed:
Smoke of incense, the cake of dried rice
And my flesh, trembling:
Obedient, ritual offering.

Gold mask on my absent face
Violet flowers for eyes,
Loveâ€™s shadow paints me with small, sure strokes;
And this bird I have breathes
And cries strangely.

A long shudder
Like wind that lifts from tree to tree
Moves the seven great ebony pharaohs
In their solemn, ornate encasings.

It is only the profundity of death that persists,
Simulating the last torment
Seeking its appeasement
And its eternity
In a light clicking of bracelets
Vain hoops, alien games
Circling the sacrificed flesh.

Avid for the fraternal source of evil in me
They lay me down and drink:
Seven times I know the vise of bones
And the dry hand that seeks my heart to break it.

Livid, gorged with the horrible dream
My limbs unlocked
And the dead, thrust out of me, assassinated,
What faint glint of dawn strays here?
Why then does this bird shiver
And turn toward morning
Its blinded eyes?
