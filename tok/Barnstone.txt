My heart is on my fist
like a blind falcon

The taciturn bird clutching my fingers
A lamp swollen with wine and blood,
I go down
Toward the tomb of kings
Astonished
Scarcely born.

What thread of Ariadne leads me
Along the deaf labyrinths
The echoing steps are swallowed one by one.

(In what dream
Was this child tied by the ankle
Like a spellbound slave?)

The author of the dream
Squeezes the thread
And naked steps come
One by one
Like the first drops of rain
On the floor of wells.

The smell already moves in bloated storms
Oozes under doorsills
Into rooms, secret and round.
Where the confined beds are stiffly erect.

The motionless desire of effigies moves me.
Astounded I watch
Black bones
Shining blue encrusted stones.

A few tragedies, patiently carved out
On the chests of kings, are displayed
As if they were jewels
And are offered to us
Without tears or regret.

In a single row:
Incense, dry rice cake.
And my quivering flesh:
Ritual and submissive offering.

The gold mask on my absent face
Purple flowers like the pupils of my eyes,
Love’s shadow paints me in small precise lines
And my bird breathes
And sobs strangely.

A long shudder
Like the wind catching tree after tree
Stirs seven great ebony pharaohs
In their solemn and ornate coverings.

It’s only the depth of death that survives,
Simulating the last torment
Looking for appeasement
And its eternity
In a light tinkling of bracelets,
Vain ring games of other places
Around the sacrificed flesh.

They sleep and drink,
Avid for the fraternal source of evil in me;
Seven times I’ve known the vise of bones
And the dry hand that looks through the heart to break it.

Livid and glutted on a horrible dream
My limbs unraveled
The dead outside of me, assassinated,
What reflection of dawn wanders here?
Why does this bird tremble
And turn its punctured eyeballs
Toward the morning?
