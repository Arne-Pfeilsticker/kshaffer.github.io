I bear my heart on my fist
Like a blind falcon.

The taciturn bird held on my fingers
A swollen lamp of wine and blood
I go down
Toward the tomb of kings
Astonished
Scarcely born

What Ariadne-thread leads me
Along the muted labyrinths?
The echo of my steps fades away as they fall

(In what dream
Was this child tied by her ankle
Like a fascinated slave?)

The maker of the dream
Presses on the cord,
Then come the naked steps
One by one
Like the first drops of rain
In the bottom of the well

Already the odour stirs in swollen storms
Seeps under the edges of the doors
Of chambers secret and round,
Where the closed beds are laid out.

The motionless desire of the recumbent dead draws me
I behold with astonishment
Encrusted upon black bones
The blue stones gleaming

A few tragedies patiently wrought
Lying on the breasts of kings
As if they were jewels
Are offered me
Without tears or regrets.

In a single rank arrayed:
The smoke of incense, the cake of dried rice,
And my flesh, which trembles:
A ceremonial and submissive offering.

A gold mask on my absent face
Violet flowers for eyes,
The shade of love paints me in small sharp strokes;
And this bird I have breathes
And complains strangely.

A long tremor
Like a wind rising, from tree to tree,
Shakes the seven tall ebony Pharaohs
In their stately and ornate cases.

It is only the profundity of death which persists,
Simulating the ultimate torment
Seeking its appeasement
And its eternity
In a faint tinkle of bracelets
Vain rings, alien games
Around the sacrificed flesh.

Greedy for the fraternal source of evil in me
They lay me down and drink me;
Seven times I know the tight grip of the bones
And the dry hand seeking my heart to break it.

Livid and satiated with the horrible dream
My limbs untied
And the dead out of me, assassinated,
What glimmer of dawn strays in here?
Wherefore does this bird quiver
And turn toward morning
Its burst pupils?
