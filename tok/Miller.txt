I have my heart on my fist
Like a blind flacon

With the taciturn bird taking my fingers
A lamp swollen with wine and blood,
I go down
Toward the tomb of Kings
Astonished
Scarcely born.

What thread of Ariadne leads me
Along the muted labyrinths?
The echo of footfall is swallowed there step by step.

(In what dream
Was this child bound by her ankle
Like a fascinated slave?)

The author of the dream
Presses on the thread,
So come the naked footsteps,
One by one
Like the first drops of rain
At the bottom of the well.

Already the odour stirs in swollen storms
Seeps from the sills of doors
Of the rooms, secret and round,
Where the enclosed beds are arrayed.

The still desire of the effigies draws me.
I gaze with astonishment
As set on the black bones
Shine the encrusted stones.

Several tragedies patiently wrought,
On the breasts of the kings, laid out
In the guise of jewels
Are offered to me
Without tears or regrets.

Ranged in a single row:
The smoke of incense, the cake of dried rice
And my trembling flesh:
Ritual and submissive offering.

The golden mask on my absent face
Violet flowers by way of eyes
The shadow of love makes me up with precise little strokes
And this bird of mine breathes
And sobs strangely.

A long shiver
Like the wind that catches, from tree to tree,
Stirs seven great ebony pharaohs
In their solemn ornate casings.

It is only the depth of death that persists,
Feigning the last torment
Seeks its appeasement
And its eternity
In a light tinkling of bracelets
Vain ring games of elsewhere
Around the sacrificed flesh.

Craving the brotherly source of evil in me
They lay me down and drink me;
Seven times, I know the vise of bones
And the dry hand that seeks the heart to break it.

Livid and gorged on horrible dream
My limbs unfettered
And the dead outside me, assassinated,
What glimmer of dawn strays here?
How is it then that this bird trembles
And turns towards the morning
Its blinded eyes?
