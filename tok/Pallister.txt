I clench my heart on my fist
Like a blind falcon

The taciturn bird caught in my fingers
Lamp swollen with wine and blood.
I descend
Towards the tomb of kings
Astonished
Scarcely born.

What Ariadne’s thread leads me
Along the muted labyrinth?
The echo of footsteps is devoured there|As I proceed

(In what dream
Was this girlchild tied by the ankle
Like an entranced slave?)

The author of the dream
Presses on the thread
And the bare footsteps fall
One by one
Like the first raindrops
At the bottom of the well

Already the odor stirs in swollen storms
Sweats under the doorsteps
In the round, secret chambers
Where the closed beds stand in a line

The motionless desire of the recumbent ones|Pulls me towards them.
I watch with astonishment
The incrusted blue stones shining
Next to the blackened bones

A few tragedies patiently elaborated,
Couched on the breast of kings
In place of jewels
Are offered to me
Without tears or regrets.

Arranged in a single line:
The smoke of incense, the cake of dry rice
And my quivering flesh:
Ritual and dutiful offering.

The golden mask on my absent face
Violet flowers instead of pupils
The shadow of love makes up my face|With accurate little strokes;
And this bird I’ve inhaled
Lament so strangely

A long shudder
Like the wind which picks up from tree to tree
Shakes seven ebony pharaohs
In the solemn bejeweled cases.

It is only the depth of death that persists
Simulating the final torment
Seeking her appeasement
And her eternity
In a slight clinking of bracelets
Circle empty reflections of other places
Around the sacrificed flesh

Thirsty to sip at the fraternal spring of evil in me
They lay me down and drink me;
Seven times I know the vice of bones
And the withered hand that seeks out the heart|So it may break it.

Livid and stuffed with horrible dream
My members unknotted
And the dead outside of me, murdered,
What reflection of dawn strays here?
How does it come that this bird quivers
And turns toward morning
His pupils put out?
