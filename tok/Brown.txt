Perched on my wrist, my heart,
Like a blind falcon.

The taciturn bird clutching my fingers
Lamp swollen with wine and blood,
I go down
Toward the tomb of kings
Astonished,
Barely born.

What Ariadne’s thread draws me
Along thudding labyrinths?
Echoes of footsteps are swallowed as they fall.

(In what dream
What this child tied by the ankle
Like some fascinated slave?)

The author of the dream
Tugs at the thread
And naked feet are heard
One by one
Like the first drops of rain
In a well’s depth.

Already the smell is moving in swollen storms
Oozes under the sills of doors
Into round secret rooms
Where the enclosed resting-places rise.

The still desire of the stone sleepers draws me on.
I see astonished
In the black bones themselves
The glow of blue encrusted stone.

A few tragedies patiently fashioned
On the chests of supine kings
In place of jewels
These are offered me
Without regret or tears.

Ranged in a row:
Smoke of the incense, rice-cakes dried
And my trembling flesh:
A humble ritual offering.

The mask of gold upon my absent face
Violet flowers for pupils
The shadow of love pains my face with careful needle- strokes;
And this bird I have|Breathes loudly
Raising its strange complaint.

A long shudder
Like the wind catching tree after tree
Shakes seven great ebony Pharaohs
In their solemn gilded cases.

It is but the last fathom of death persisting
Miming a final torment
Seeking relief
And its own eternity
In a soft clatter of bracelets
Vain playthings from elsewhere
Circling the sacrificed flesh.

Hungry for the fraternal source of evil in me
They lay me down, they drink me;
Seven times I feel the tightening vice of bones
And the dry hand seeking my heart to crush it.

Livid and stated from a horrid dream
My limbs set free
And the dead out of me, assassinated
What glimmer of dawn is this, wandering lost?
How comes it that this bird
Trembles and turns towards morning
His punctured eyes?
