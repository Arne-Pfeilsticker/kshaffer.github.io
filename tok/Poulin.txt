My heart’s on my fist
Like a blind falcon

This taciturn bird gripping my fingers
Lamp swollen with wine and blood
I go down
Towards the tomb of kings
Amazed
Barely born

What Ariadne’s thread leads me
Through the muffled labyrinths?
Echoes of footsteps swallow themselves

(In what dream
Was this child’s ankle bound
Like a spellbound slave?)

The author of the dream
Pulls the thread
And naked steps start coming
One by one
Like the first drops of rain
At the bottom of wells.

The smell already stirs in swollen storms,
Oozes under the doorsills
Into the round and secret rooms
Where the walled-in beds are raised.

The dead’s torpid desire tugs at me.
Astonished I watch
The blue encrusted stones
Shine among black bones.

A few patiently wrought tragedies
On the breasts of reclining kings
Are offered to me
Like jewels
Without regret or tears.

In one straight line:
The smoke of incense, dried rice cakes
And my trembling flesh:
Humble and ritual offering.

A gold mask on my absent face,
Violet flowers for my eyes,
The shadow of love, precise little lines of my make-up.
And this bird I have|Breathes
And complains strangely.

A long shiver
Like the wind catching from tree to tree
Stirs seven great ebony Pharaohs
In their solemn decorated cases.

Only the depths of death persists,
Simulating the final agony
Seeking its appeasement
And its eternity
In a thin clash of bracelets,
Vain circles of foreign games
Around the sacrificed flesh.

Avid for the fraternal source of evil in me,
They lay me down and drink me:
Seven times I feel the grip of bones,
The dry hand hunting my heart to break it.

Livid and satiated with foul dreams,
My limbs freed
And the dead thrown out of me, assassinated,
What reflection of dawn wanders in here?
Why does this bird shiver
And turn toward dawn
Its gouged eyes?
