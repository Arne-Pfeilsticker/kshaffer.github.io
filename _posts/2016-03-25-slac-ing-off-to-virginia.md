Our time in Boulder is coming to a close. This June I will be joining the [Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies](https://academics.umw.edu/dtlt/) at the [University of Mary Washington](http://www.umw.edu/) as an instructional technology specialist. UMW is a leader when it comes to the critical use of educational technology, especially at a Small Liberal Arts College (SLAC). I'm really excited about the combination of digital technology and the public liberal arts mission, and Mary Washington does it better than just about anyone.

At UMW, I will focus on strategy and development for the [Domain of One's Own](http://umw.domains/) project, the incorporation of digital media (specializing in audio and music) into both in-person and online courses, and a variety of other issues related to teaching with technology. I will also have the opportunity to teach interdisciplinary freshman seminars and courses in the Digital Studies program, and possibly other courses in the future. Perhaps most exciting is that I'll be joining a great team at DTLT ― [Jesse Stommel](http://jessestommel.com/), [Lee Skallerup Bessette](http://readywriting.org/), [Jess Reingold](http://jessicareingold.com/), and not long after I start, [Nigel Haarstad](https://twitter.com/NigelHaarstad) ― as well as other amazing people in the Teaching, Technology, and Innovation unit at UMW. I'm super excited about the work I'll be doing and the people I'll be working with.

That said, my family and I will be sad to leave Boulder. I've enjoyed my time at CU, we have made many friends here, and the boys are in a great school. Colleen has also found many great performance opportunities in the Front Range. However, the move to Fredericksburg will bring us closer to most of our extended family, allow our boys to see their cousins regularly, and will be more financially sustainable for us in the long run. (It is very difficult to support a family of five in Boulder primarily via a non-tenure-track salary, even with copious overload courses.) So while we will miss our friends, colleagues, and the opportunities available in Colorado ― not to mention the Rocky Mountains! ― we are excited about what life in Fredericksburg has to bring.
