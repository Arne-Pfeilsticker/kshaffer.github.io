***intro needed***

A *corpus* is a selection of works to be analyzed, usually through computational means. In statistical terms, some musical corpus studies analyze *populations* and other musical corpus studies analyze *samples*. The distinction between a population and a sample is an important one with implications for both how an analysis is conducted and how it is interpreted.

A *population* is the entire body of work that an analyst seeks to understand. A *sample* is a portion of that population whose characteristics can be used to draw conclusions about the characteristics of the population. The characteristics of the population are called *parameters*, and these are the characteristics that an analyst is ultimately interested in finding and exploring. The characteristics of the sample, from which an analyst makes determinations about the population, are called *statistics*. 

Typically, an analyst uses a sample instead of a population because the population is too large to manage in a study. For example, it is impractical for a political pollster to survey all likely voters in a national election. Instead, the pollster selects a sample of the population of likely voters to stand in for the population. Music scholars, on the other hand, often have access to the entire populations they are studying. For instance, Bach's four-part chorales are readily available, even in digital form, and are of manageable length. In such a case, a scholar does not need to limit analysis to a sample, particularly when using computational means that can be applied to the entire population as easily as to a sample.

In some cases, however, music scholars must deal with samples. For instance, in a study of late twentieth-century popular music, Renaissance polyphony, or German Romantic *Lieder*, populations are  large, and a scholar may not have ready access to every member of the population in an encoding format that sufficiently encapsulates all of the musical features relevant to the study. However, a random selection of the population, properly analyzed, can provide substantial insight into the characteristics of the population.

In still other cases, a population can function as a sample of a hypothetical larger population. For example, a professor may assign her theory students the task of composing a four-part chorale in the style of Bach. The entire collection of Bach's chorales comprise the population *Bach's chorales*. However, in this case of student chorales in the style of Bach, Bach's chorales and the not-yet-composed student chorales are together part of the population *Bachian chorales*. Bach's chorales are a sample of this larger hypothetical population, and the students are charged with composing pieces that also belong to that population. In other words, the characteristics of Bach's chorales are indicative of parameters of a larger population, and the students are to compose another sample of chorales whose characteristics are indicative of the same parameters.

The difference between these three situations—a population, a sample, and a population functioning like a sample—leads to different methods of calculation and interpretation of the data collected. For instance, when describing the characteristics of a population, there is no need to account for variance or chance. Provided that data has been accurately collected and tallied, those tallies are the parameters. If dealing with a sample, however, and there is significant variance between the characteristics of the members of the sample, the characteristics of the population can only be described by a range of possible values. And if a population is functioning as a sample, then the analyst must be careful to account for variance in the corpus, even though it is not necessary when the same corpus functions as a population.

Take the election poll example above. When a pollster polls a sample of the voting population, variance between different groups in that sample provides a margin of error. If, for example, one candidate carries 51% of the poll, and the other 49%, but the margin of error is 3%, the poll is a tie. However, once election day comes and the population votes, even a difference of a single vote is a decisive election (provided all hanging chads have been accounted for!). This is because the ballots in question *are* the population, and ascertaining and interpreting their characteristics are the analytical goal. However, the characteristics of the sample (the poll) are only indicative of the characteristics of the population and are not always sufficient to draw conclusions about the population.

Thus, when conducting a corpus study on music, it is important to define the population in question, establish whether the corpus selected is a population or a sample, and conduct the analysis accordingly. This distinction determines both the methods necessary for performing the analysis, and the conclusions that can be drawn from the analysis.
