Academic assessments always test more than we think.

For example, recent studies have found that timed quizzes in K–12 math classes measure a student's cognitive working memory load, as well as their ability to make basic calculations quickly. Likewise, these timed tests measure a student's level of anxiety—and in many cases, they contribute to it, as well. (See Jo Boaler's ["Research suggests timed tests cause math anxiety"](http://newsroom.unl.edu/announce/csmce/3499/18149) for more information on these and other studies.)

We use the same kind of timed quizzes in music theory courses to assess student fluency in fundamental concepts of notation and structure. And though no studies hae been done (to my knowledge), I suspect that my timed quizzes have some of the same negative effects. In fact, I'm positive that they do for at least some of my students.

So can we do it differently? Can we accomplish the same pedagogical goals without timed quizzes? And maybe even do it better? 

I think so.

My pedagogical goals for these fundamentals (scales, key signatures, chords, meter, rhythm, etc.) is to help my students achieve fluency in these concepts before they move on to higher-level musical tasks like composing analyzing music that uses these basic structures. And by fluency, I mean that the basic "vocabulary" and "grammar" for these elements are stored in students' long-term memory, at a high enough level of pre-activation and with enough connections with other musical concepts and atcitivies that they are recognized immediately in context, or recalled with minimal effort.

I use timed quizzes (usually giving students 3–4 times the amount of time it takes me to perform the same task) to assess students' ability to recognize or quickly recall these basic elements in context, as well as to motivate students to spend out-of-class time working on memorization. That way, class time can be devoted to more interesting, and more complex things.

But there's a problem. Just as in math, timed quizzes cause anxiety. Even though my students can take them multiple times until they pass (90% accuracy in the time given) with impunity, even though they are open-note, there is a ["habit field"](http://alistapart.com/article/habit-fields) surrounding these tests (HT: [Andrew Crust](https://twitter.com/andrewjcrust)). For some students, these tests bring with them memories of past success in high-stakes testing environments. But increasingly, anything that looks like a high-stakes, high-pressure academic test brings with it negative emotional memories from students' past. So even if the concept and grading scheme are not particularly anxiety-producing in and of themselves, the timed quiz may elicit anxiety because of these memories, the timed-quiz "habit field."


Perhaps even more importantly, since we tend to begin a two-year sequence of courses in music theory with several weeks of regularly scheduled timed quizzes (in my case, the beginning of every class meeting), these quizzes set the tone for the whole course sequence. Instead of preparing students for two years of exploration, inquiry, and stimulating challenges, these quizzes generate an expectation that music theory is about intellectual performance and the regurgitation of known answers. 

So how can we promote, and assess, fluency with these basic musical concepts without resurrecting students' anxiety-producing "habit fields"? And more importantly, can we promote fluency in a way that also sets the tone for high-level, critical inquiry in our subsequent studies of musical structure?
